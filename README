  - reservations that aren't being used
  - running instances that aren't reserved
  - cost savings if you were to reserve all running on-demand instances

Requires: ~/.boto, boto lib, texttable lib

Running:
./rize.py

# run, but exclude instances with security group matching -e <regex>
./rize.py -e '^ElasticMap.*'

# run in us-west-2,
./rize.py -r us-west-2

# list all reserved instances and exit
./rize.py -l
