rize.py:

Script to analyze reserved instance utilization.
Currently: assumes 1-year heavy utilization reserved instances.

Identifies:
  - reservations that aren't being used (and the total monthly cost/waste)
  - running instances that aren't reserved
  - cost savings if you were to reserve all running on-demand instances
  - time to recoup up-front reservation costs

Supports us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1.

Requires: ~/.boto, boto lib, texttable lib

Running:
./rize.py

# run, but exclude instances with security group matching -e <regex>
./rize.py -e '^ElasticMap.*'

# run in us-west-2,
./rize.py -r us-west-2

# list all reserved instances and exit
./rize.py -l

# operate only on VPC instances/reservations
./rize.py --vpc
